## üîß Configuration

### API Integration
The dashboard uses a Vite proxy to handle CORS issues with the Rebase Energy API:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'https://api.rebase.energy',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
        secure: true,
      }
    }
  }
})
```
